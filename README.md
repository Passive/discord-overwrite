Strange bug I found whilst testing some different aspects of discord. Enjoy :)


### How do I use it?

Run the .py file and send the QR code wherever you want, when they scan it this strange bug will trigger.

### What does it do?

If you refresh it basically soft-bricks your discord. You have to restart and install updates again. I seen it deletes index.js in discord_desktop_core

### How does it work

My theory is that since this is an old feature, it is no longer supported and for some reason messes with your client?? Also it does not have to be in a qr code
just for the record.
